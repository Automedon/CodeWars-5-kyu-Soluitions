/*
Description:
Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
*/

const moveZeros = arr => arr.reduceRight((acc,val)=>val===0?[...acc, val]:[val,...acc],[])
