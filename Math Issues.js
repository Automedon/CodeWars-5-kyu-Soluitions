Description:
Oh no, our Math object was "accidently" reset. Can you re-implement some of those functions? We can assure, that only non-negative numbers are passed as arguments. So you don't have to consider things like undefined, null, NaN, negative numbers, strings and so on.

Here is a list of functions, we need:

Math.round()
Math.ceil()
Math.floor()
*/
Math.round = function(number) {
  return (number - parseInt(number) >= 0.5) ? parseInt(number) + 1 : parseInt(number) ;
};

Math.ceil = function(number) {
  return (parseInt(number) === number) ? number : parseInt(number) + 1;
};

Math.floor = function(number) {
  return parseInt(number);
};
